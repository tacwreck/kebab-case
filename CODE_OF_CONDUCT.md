# Code of Conduct for kebab-case 🥙

We're all here to grill great code and have fun. This project is like a kebab party: welcoming, tasty, and drama-free!

## Our Pledge
We want everyone to feel welcome—whether you're a newbie flipping your first script or a pro master chef of code. No matter your background, experience, or favorite sauce.

## Expected Behavior
- Be kind and respectful (high-fives, not burns 🔥)
- Use welcoming language
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism (like "add more veggies" to your code)
- Focus on what's best for the community (extra spice for everyone!)

## Unacceptable Behavior
No thanks to:
- Harassment, trolling, or insults
- Personal attacks or spicy-roast-level negativity
- Sharing private info without permission
- Anything that'd get you kicked out of a real kebab shop 😏

## Enforcement
If something's off, the maintainers (me, for now) will step in—could mean a warning, editing/removing stuff, or a temp/perma ban from contributing. We'll be fair, but the grill stays hot and friendly.

## Reporting Issues
Spot something uncool? Open an issue or email [YOUR EMAIL] privately. We'll handle it discreetly and quickly.

## Attribution
Inspired by simple open-source CoCs (like Auth0's and Google's) but with extra kebab flavor.

Let's keep the vibes delicious! 🌶️🥙
