**The spiciest Node.js starter repo on GitHub!**  
Like a perfect kebab: layered, flavorful, and impossible to put down. 

## What's Cooking?

This is a fresh Node.js project template with:
- Clean `.gitignore` (no junk files)
- GitHub Actions for automation (your code gets tested before it burns)
- Professional setup (but with puns, because boring repos are overcooked)

Right now, it's a starter skewer—add your meat (code) as you go!

## Quick Start (Don't Burn It!)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/kebab-case.git
cd kebab-case
npm init -y  # Or just add your package.json goodies
node index.js  # Taste the spice!
